# Versioning

We follow [semver](https://semver.org/) rules for versioning releases.

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when you make changes in libraries and other infrastructural elements;
2. `MINOR` version when you make changes in rule groups or rules added to "other" group;
3. `PATCH` version when you make changes in other than "other" rule groups (which means just following the expected standards by improving the support of them), fix bugs or improve documentation.
